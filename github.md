I chose FiveThirtyEight's project, "Where Police Have Killed Americans in 2015." The article caught my eye for two reasons: the topic of police shootings is an unsolved issue that is increasingly relevant, and my grad school research is to build a statistical model to predict Chicago crime. By choosing this project, I hoped to gain a better understanding of police shootings, and see if FiveThirtyEight's analysis could be applied to my own research. 

The project folder on github gives a dataset that includes Police Killing data from the Guardian database combined with data from the American Community Survey. I would be very curious to know more about what tools FiveThirtyEight used to mine the Census data, Bing Maps, and Google APIs. I'm also curious about the statement in the article that says "official statistics on police killings are deeply flawed." Why are official statistics flawed? This would be useful information to know as I conduct my own research. I'm also interested in knowing how FiveThirtyEight plans on analyzing this data in the future. At the time of the article, June 3, 2015, there were only 467 data entries. With more entries, I'm sure the analysis has become much more robust with stronger inferences.
